# crystallography_bluesky

Bluesky plans, plan stubs, and utilities for crystallography beamlines

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

Releases        | <https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/crystallography-bluesky/releases>

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from crystallography_bluesky import __version__

print(f"Hello crystallography_bluesky {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m crystallography_bluesky --version
```
